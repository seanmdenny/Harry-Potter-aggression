```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load packages and read in data

```{r, message = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
hp_data <- read_csv("harry_potter_aggression_full.csv")

```

2. Basic wrangling and make a graph of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy aggression rates.

```{r}
hp_graph <- hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% 
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = book, y = agg.per.mention)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip()

hp_graph

#Something kind of annoying with 'dodge' is that if there isn't a value for one of the two variables, the other is spread across the entire column. E.g. second to last set. 
  
```
